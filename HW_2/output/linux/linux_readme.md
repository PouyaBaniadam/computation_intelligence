To run your generated executable on Linux, open your terminal in the folder containing the file and follow these steps:

### 1. Make the file executable
This grants the file permission to run as a program.

```bash
chmod +x HW_2
```

### 2. Run the file
You must use `./` to tell Linux to look in the **current folder** (it will not run without this).

```bash
./HW_2
```
